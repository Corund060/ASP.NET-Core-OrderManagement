# ASP.NET-Core-OrderManagement

Order management program:
1. Login/Sign up functionality
2. List of Items (whole CRUD).
3. Order CRUD - in order I can add multiple items, set price discount and calculate total amount. Total amount can have discount as well. (like a promo code or something like this)
4. In the list of orders I want to have button to change order status – Ordered, Processed, Shipped, Completed, Paid, Closed.
5. Filters on list of orders regarding status
6.Provider – always the same (can be hardcoded company with Name, code, address, VAT code and etc. )
7.Customer – can be entered manually when creating order but then it should be saved and in the next creation dropdown should allow me to select from already existing customers.
